                Above all else, the main goal of the team is to keep everyone synchronized and working towards the
                objective of creating a user-friendly, functional search engine. We plan on meeting weekly to discuss
                achievements from the previous week, set goals for the current week, and address any setbacks or
                blockers team members are facing. By meeting frequently, we aim to maintain a high quality of work and
                stay on track to achieve all project goals.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Risk Management</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The largest risk is a team member not completing required work in a timely manner or not
                at all. We plan to mitigate this issue via our weekly meetings, weâ€™ll be able to identify this
                problem quickly and spread the work out between the rest of the team.
